## CookItEasy
CookItEasy is a simple web application, designed for Mobile primarily (but responsivenes) that lists lots of great recipes (especially mine).
I started this for project for practicing Rails a little more and in the same time coding an app I was needed.
I did all the coding using Ruby on Rails for the back-end and JavaScript feat TailWind for the front-end.
I used Heroku to deploy the app, with a PostgreSQL database and Cloudinary to host pictures to be displayed in the app.

## Get started
First, you need to create an account, if you want to see all the features.
Then you can add your own recipes, see them in the tab "My recipes" and any recipes in your favorites.
Quite simple but very pratical ðŸ˜‰
